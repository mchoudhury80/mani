1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
   integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
 
	1.1- * is an expression.(Multiplication operater)
	1.2- 'hello'is a string value.
	1.3- -87.8 is a float value.
	1.4- - is an expression.(subtraction operater)
	1.5- / is an expression.(division operater)
	1.6- + is an expression.(Addition operater)
	1.7- 6 is an integer value.

2. What is the difference between string and variable?

   A variable can hold a string, but a string can't hold a variable.variable are used to store values.And variables have data type
    Ex.i= 100
	   j=i
	   k=[1,2,3]
	   str1="hello"
	   name='any name'
	   i,j,k,str1,name are all variables
	   
	A string is the values inside the quotes assigned to a string.String is a data type. str1,name are variables of data type string.

3. Describe three different data types.

   Numaric-In Python, numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. Numeric value can be integer, floating number or even
     complex numbers. These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python
	 Ex.x = int(20)Integer: integer can store only numerical values
	  x = float(20.5)Float: float can store only floating values.
      x = complex(1j)
   Sequence Type- sequence is the ordered collection of similar or different data types. Sequences allows to store multiple values in an organized and efficient fashion. There are several sequence types in Python
     Ex.x = str("Hello World")
	    x = list['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']List: the list is used for storing multiple data items in a single variable.
		x = tuple('apple', 'banana', 'cherry'
​   Dictionary- Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value  pair in a
   Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.
     Ex.x = dict{'name': 'John', 'age': 36}   

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do? 

   Expression is a combination of values,variables,mathematical operaters and calls to functions.Expressions need to be evaluate. 
    Ex.a = b+c-5
	and expressions are used to evaluate the values or represent the result on the screen.
	
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
   expression and a statement?
   
    Expressions need to be evaluate.If you can print it, or assign it to a variable, it’s an expression.
   Ex.a=2+2
	  a=3*4
	  b=min(2,24)
	  
   If you can’t evaluate, it’s a statement.print is a statement,which means it is a single command that does not evaluate to anything,and
   therefore cannot be assigned to a variable.
   Ex.if CONDITION:
	  elif CONDITION:
	  while CONDITION:
	  
6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?

	bacon = 22

	bacon + 1

	out: it gives 23 as execution code 
	
7. What should the values of the following two terms be?

	'spam' + 'spamspam'

	'spam' * 3

	out: it will be the same
   
8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?

	Because we can't start giving variable an integer name. if we, we should begin with, a string-like alphabet name then integer. e100 or eggs100 is valid.
	
9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?

	 String = str(),
	 Integer = int(),
	 Floating-point = float()

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
	'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'

	 Because 99 is an integer it cannot be concatenated with strings, if we have to concatenate it we need to do typecasting.
	 fix:'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
